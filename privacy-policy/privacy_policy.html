You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Rabbit VR and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.</p>

                <p>If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Rabbit VR, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Rabbit VR product or a Rabbit VR account provided by your organization, please see the Products provided by your organization and the Rabbit VR account sections for more information.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.</p>

                <h4 style="font-weight: lighter">How we use personal data
                </h4>
                <hr>

                <p>Rabbit VR uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:</p>

                <ul >
                    <li > Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>

                <li>
                    Improve and develop our products.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Personalize our products and make recommendations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.
                    </li>

                </ul>


                <p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Rabbit VR products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>

                <p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies. This manual review may be conducted by Rabbit VR employees or vendors who are working on Rabbit VR’s behalf.</p>

                    <p>
                        When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Rabbit VR as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>More on the purposes of processing:</b></p>
                    <ul><li><b>Provide our products</b>. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use VRDrive, we process the documents you upload to VRDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.
                    </li><li><b>Product improvement</b>. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.
                    </li><li><b>Personalization</b>. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Rabbit VR Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Rabbit VR account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.
                    </li><li><b>Product activation</b>. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation.
                    </li><li><b>Product development</b>. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.
                    </li><li><b>Customer support</b>. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Rabbit VR to provide support services and investigate security incidents.
                    </li><li><b>Help secure and troubleshoot</b>. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
                    </li><li><b>Safety</b>. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.  <b>In accordance with European Union Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery (known as a “hash set”), in a process called “hash matching”. Rabbit VR obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement authorities.</b></li><li><b>Updates</b>. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates.
                    </li><li><b>Promotional communications</b>. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Rabbit VR by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the <b>How to access and control your personal data</b></a>
                        section of this privacy statement.
                    </li><li><b>Relevant offers</b>. Rabbit VR uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to  predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.
                    </li><li><b>Advertising</b>. Rabbit VR does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.
                    </li><li><b>Prize promotions and events</b>. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Rabbit VR Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.
                    </li><li><b>Transacting commerce</b>. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Rabbit VR Store.

                <p>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on VRDrive, or link accounts with another service. If you use a Rabbit VR product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Rabbit VR products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.
                </p>

                <p>In addition, we share personal data among Rabbit VR-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working
                    on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</p>
